This beautifully designed "tap and swipe" game has been put together with special consideration to develop young minds.
</p><p>
As part of Key Stage One, children learn the spelling of basic words through phonics. Basic Bear Words has been developed to aid children in the the process of learning how to spell and pronounce 58 simple words as the base for more complex words used in the english language.
These words are as simple as "ball", "dog" and "cat".

        </p>
        <p>
This game was developed by a parent, with children in mind, no data is collected by the app, there are no in-app purchases, no device permissions.
</p><p>
If you play it and like it - please review it, so others will know!
</p><p>
Give your child the gift of “learning for fun” for less than a cup of coffee!
